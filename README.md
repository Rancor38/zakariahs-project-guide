# Zakariah's Project Preparation Guidelines

When preparing your project for class, keep the following guidelines in mind.

## Portfolio Function

The primary function of your project in your portfolio is to showcase your abilities. Ensure that the application you present is functional, even if it is a simple implementation. It is essential to demonstrate that your vision can be transformed into a working app.

## User Stories

Create user stories to define the goals and experiences of your users. As you develop these stories, consider the steps involved in implementing them. Differentiate between user stories that are necessary for the core functionality of your app and those that are "nice to have." Build your Minimum Viable Product (MVP) based on the essential user stories. Pay attention to the user experience and how users will interact with your app.

## Wireframes

Design wireframes that outline the visual layout and structure of your app. While wireframes don't need to be aesthetically pleasing, detailed planning will help you address underlying issues and seek assistance in developing an intentional application.

## Pseudocode

Before writing code, start by creating pseudocode. Ensure that you have a clear understanding of the problem you are trying to solve and the purpose of each line of code. Pseudocode provides a roadmap for your implementation.

## Problem-Solving Approach

Focus on solving one problem at a time. Only move on to the next problem once you have successfully resolved and tested the previous one. This systematic approach will help you stay organized and make steady progress.

## README Guidelines

Your README file serves as an initial introduction to your app. Treat it as a resume for your project, providing an overview of what it is, the technologies involved, and instructions for users or developers on how to engage with it. Make sure to:

- Clearly explain the purpose and functionality of your app.
- Detail the technologies used in its development.
- Provide instructions for users or developers on how to effectively use the app.
- Remove non-functional buttons, unnecessary console logs, and commented-out code. Keep the project clean and finished while retaining descriptive comments.

## Time Management

If you spend more than 20 minutes on a particular problem without making progress, don't hesitate to seek assistance. It is important to ask for help rather than struggling alone. Additionally, remember to take regular breaks and have lunch to maintain focus and productivity.

## Setting Feature Deadlines

Prior to presenting your work, set a strict deadline for additional features. Ensure that your app is fully functional by this deadline. It may be challenging to leave some aspects unfinished, but it is more important to have a completed and working app. Avoid working on the project late into the night before the deadline, as it will likely introduce more issues than it resolves.
